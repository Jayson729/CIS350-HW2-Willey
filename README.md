## Jayson Willey
- My biggest interest is probably video games, my favorite games are probably Minecraft, Super Mario Galaxy, and Hollow Knight
- I enjoy building computers, I've built 4 computers for friends before and I enjoy the part finding and actual building process
- I've also been teaching myself piano for about the past year and a half, which has been fun
### Technical Background
The programming languages I've mostly used are Python, Java, and C. I learned these mainly through classes. I've also used git quite a bit in my classes.
